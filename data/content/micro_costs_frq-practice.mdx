# FRQ 1
Explain briefly why MC begins to slope up exponentially after a certain point (in most cases).

<FRQ num={1} totalPoints={2}>
<FRQCheck points={2}>
Due to the law of increasing costs, the cost to produce one more unit after a certain point will eventually go up.
<ul>
<li> +1 for bringing up law of increasing costs </li>
<li> +1 for saying that the cost for marginal units would eventually go up </li>
</ul>
</FRQCheck>
</FRQ>

# FRQ 2
<ol className="alpha-list-mdx">
<li> Describe the difference between fixed and variable costs, and list an example of each. </li>
<li> What will be the average fixed cost in the long run? </li>
</ol>

<FRQ num={1} totalPoints={2}>
<FRQCheck points={4}>
+2 for saying that fixed costs are constant in some time frame, while variable costs can be changed in said time frame.
<ul>
<li>+1 for giving some example of fixed costs, such as land</li>
<li>+1 for giving some example of variable costs, such as labor</li>
</ul>
</FRQCheck>
<FRQCheck points={1}>
Zero, because by definition nothing can be held constant in the long run.
</FRQCheck>
</FRQ>

# FRQ 3
Explain, given several short run average cost curves, how to determine the long run average cost.

<FRQ num={1} totalPoints={2}>
<FRQCheck points={2}>
To find the long run average cost, we plot the short run average cost curves, and draw the long run average cost such that it meets each curve at the point of smallest per unit cost.
<ul>
<li> +1 for stating to plot short run average cost curves </li>
<li> +1 for stating to draw the curve through the points of lowest average cost on each curve. </li>
</ul>
