<ol className="alpha-list-mdx">
  <li>
    Give the maximum number of cars that can currently be made if 4 stoves are
    produced, and explain why. Assume the production possibilities frontier is
    perfectly linear.
  </li>
  <li>
    The marginal cost for Taiwan between stoves and cars is 3 cars per stove.
    Assuming Japan and Taiwan want to trade, what should Japan specialize in
    producing? Explain.
  </li>

      +1 for saying the desired point is the point corresponding to x=4 on the
      PPC
    </li>
  </FRQCheck>
  <FRQCheck points={2}>
    <li>
      +2 for saying stoves, because the marginal cost is 0.5 cars per stove, so
      Japan has a comparative advantage in stoves and Taiwan has a comparative
      advantage in cars{' '}
