Camden's Cakery is one of many dessert cafés serving a local community. Each café produces a slightly differentiated product, there are no barriers to entry or exit, and the firm is in long-run equilibrium.

<ol className='alpha-list-mdx'>
<li> Draw a correctly labeled graph showing Camden's demand curve, marginal revenue curve, marginal cost curve, and long-run average total cost curve. Label Camden's profit-maximizing output $Q$ and its price $P$. </li>
<li> On your graph in part (a), label the output at which total revenue is maximized $Q_R$. </li>
<li> Do firms in this market experience economies of scale, diseconomies of scale, or neither in long-run equilibrium? Explain. </li>
</ol>

	<li> <b>+1 -</b> One point is earned for showing the price, $P_m$, on the demand curve above $Q_m$ </li>

<FRQCheck points={1}>
	Firms in this market are experiencing economies of scale in long-run equilibrium because LRATC is decreasing OR because Qm is to the left of the minimum point of the LRATC.
