# FRQ 2
Assume that the market basket cost for the base year is 90 and the market basket cost for the current year is 120. 
What is the CPI for the current year?

<FRQ num={2} totalPoints={2}>
	<FRQCheck points={1}>
		$\text{CPI} = \frac{120}{90} \times 100$
	</FRQCheck>

# FRQ 3
Post Town is a very small town that only sells mangos and apples. Their prices, in dollars, are displayed below.
|      | Mangos | Apples |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2007 | 5      | 2      |
| 2012 | 7      | 3      |
Assume that in 2021, 7 mangos and 12 apples were purchased.

		Nominal: $7 \times 7 + 12 \times 3 = \boxed{\text{\textdollar}85}$, Real: $7 \times 5 + 12 \times 2 = \boxed{\text{\textdollar}59}$.
		2 points for each correct answer.

		GDP Deflator = $\frac{85}{59} \approx 1.4407 = \boxed{144.07\%}$.
