# FRQ 1
<ol className='alpha-list-mdx'>
<li> List the 4 components of circular markets. </li>
<li> Describe how consumers participate in the factor market, according to the circular flow model. </li>
</ol>

<FRQ num={1} totalPoints={5}>
<FRQCheck points={4}>
+1 point for each of the following (partial credit for each component answer)
<ul>
<li> Factors of production (land / labor / capital) </li>
<li> Income (wages) </li>
<li> Consumer Spending </li>
<li> Goods and services </li>
</ul>
</FRQCheck>
<FRQCheck points={1}>
A consumer gives land, labor, or capital to a firm through the factor market, in exchange for income.
</FRQCheck>

# FRQ 2
<ol className='alpha-list-mdx'>
<li> What market structure are monopsonies similar to? </li>
<li> How do its wages and quantity of workers hired compare to a competitive market? </li>
</ol>

<FRQ num={2} totalPoints={3}>
<FRQCheck points={1}>
Monopsonies are similar to monopolies.
</FRQCheck>
<FRQCheck points={2}>
Wages and quantity are both lower in a monopsony compared to a perfectly competitive labor market.
</FRQCheck>
</FRQ>

# FRQ 3
<ol className='alpha-list-mdx'>
<li> List one reason almost all firms in the real world have some monopsony power. </li>
<li> In the case of monopsony power, how would a union affect wages and employment? </li>
</ol>

<FRQ num={3} totalPoints={1}>
<FRQCheck points={1}>
Include any reason, such as the following:
<ul>
<li> In practice, it is difficult for workers to shift between employers. </li>
<li> There are significant costs and immobilities to moving between jobs. </li>
<li> Firms have a degree of monopsony power which enables them to pay wages lower than a competitive equilibrium </li>
<li> Existence of unemployment gives firms more monopsony power </li>
<li> Some workers have only a limited choice of employers </li>
</ul>
</FRQCheck>
<FRQCheck points={2}>
A trade union would use its strike threat power to increase the wage a firm pays. Due to the increase in wage, and increase in labor supply must follow.
Therefore, a union would theoretically *increase* both wages and employment.
</FRQCheck>
</FRQ>

# FRQ 4
What is the slope of the supply curve in a firm graph for a perfectly competitive factor market?

<FRQ num={4} totalPoints={1}>
<FRQCheck points={1}>
The slope of the supply curve in a firm graph in a perfectly competitive factor market is *zero*.
