# FRQ 1
Determine if goods A and B are complements or substitutes
<ol className='alpha-list-mdx'>
<li> An increase in the price of good A results in a decrease in demand for good B </li>
<li> Good A can be replaced with good B with very little impact</li>
<li> A decrease in the price of good A results in a decrease in demand for good B </li>
<li> Goods A and B are commonly purchased together </li>

# FRQ 2
<ol className='alpha-list-mdx'>
<li> The price of a bag of chips decreases by 4%. If chips are unit price elastic, what is the change in quantity demanded? </li>
<li> Which of the following is expected to be more price elastic with respect to demand, a bag of chips that can wait, or an EpiPen that must be administered immediately? Explain. </li>
</ol>

<FRQ num={2} totalPoints={3}>
<FRQCheck points={1}>
+1 for a 4% increase
</FRQCheck>
<FRQCheck points={2}>
<ul>
<li>+1 for the bag of chips</li>
<li>for stating that the bag of chips is not as imminently needed as the EpiPen, so people will be more willing to wait for prices to decrease for the bag of chips.</li>

# FRQ 3
Assorted short FRQs
<ol className='alpha-list-mdx'>
<li> Assume that apples are a necessity and oranges are substitutable. How would the quantity demanded change for oranges compared to apples if both goods saw a price increase of 1%? </li>
<li> Assume that price elasticity of demand for an item is exceptionally low. How would a per unit tax on the item affect consumers? </li>
<li> How would the price elasticity of demand for soil in general compare to the price elasticity of demand for non-organic soil from Wyoming, and why? </li>
<li> For which type of goods would the Income Elasticity of Demand be negative? For which type of goods would the Income Elasticity be positive? </li>
<li> What does a price elasticity of supply of 0 indicate about a product? </li>
</ol>

<FRQ num={3} totalPoints={8}>
<FRQCheck points={4}>
<ul>
<li>+1 for “more”</li>
<li>+3 for saying that apples are more needed than oranges so price elasticity of demand is lower, and therefore an equivalent price increase for apples and oranges would lead to a greater change in the quantity demanded of oranges</li>
</ul>
</FRQCheck>
<FRQCheck points={1}>
+1 for saying that the consumers would pay a large portion of the tax. <br />
*Note: No information on elasticity of supply, so there cannot be any comparison on whether producers or consumers would pay more of the tax.*
</FRQCheck>
<FRQCheck points={1}>
+1 for stating that it is higher, because there are fewer substitutes for Wyoming inorganic soil than there are for regular soil.
</FRQCheck>
<FRQCheck points={1}>
+1 for Inferior Goods for the first and Normal goods for the second
</FRQCheck>
<FRQCheck points={1}>
+1 for stating that it indicates that the supply will not change no matter changes in price.
