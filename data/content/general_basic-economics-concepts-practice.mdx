# FRQ 1
Joe does not make money from eating chocolate chocolate chip ice cream. He could have mowed the neighborâ€™s lawn for $50 or babysat a cat for $10. What is the opportunity cost of Joe eating ice cream at this point in time?

# FRQ 2
<ol className="alpha-list-mdx">
<li> List three basic assumptions of economics.
<li> Describe an example of producer choices.
<li> Describe an example of consumer choices.
</ol>

# FRQ 3
Decide if each of the following is microeconomics or macroeconomics and explain.
<ol className="alpha-list-mdx">
<li> The costs for one specific firm, JacobCo which is a national monopoly.
<li> GDP of the United States
<li> The effects of unionization of the labor market in Pusheentown
<li> The effects of a recession on the micronation of Monaco
</ol>

# FRQ 4
Describe a difference between short and long run.

# FRQ 5
Joe makes optimal decisions with regards to eating chocolate chocolate chip ice cream.
<ol className="alpha-list-mdx">
<li> Assume the marginal cost is fixed at 3 utils per cone. What will be the marginal benefit of the last ice cream cone he eats?
<li> If the marginal benefit starts at 15 utils on the first cone and decreases by 4 utils for each following cone, what will be the number of cones that Joe eats?
</ol>

# FRQ 6
<ol className="alpha-list-mdx">
<li> How would you find the total benefit at a certain quantity Q if you were given the marginal benefits of all of the quantities up to Q?
<li> If marginal benefit starts less than marginal cost for eating cookies, how many cookies should be eaten?
</ol>

# Solutions

<FRQ num={1} totalPoints={1}>
<FRQCheck points={1}>
<li> +1 for $50, because we take the maximum utility among all alternatives to find the opportunity cost
</li>
</FRQCheck>
</FRQ>
<FRQ num={2} totalPoints={3}>
<FRQCheck points={1}>
<li>+1 for each assumption. Possible answers include: 
<ul>
<li> Society's wants are unlimited, but resources are limited.
<li> Due to scarcity, choices must be made. Every choice has a cost.
<li> Everyone acts in their own self-interest.
<li> Everyone's goal is to make choices that maximize their satisfaction. 
<li> Everyone acts rationally by comparing the marginal costs and marginal benefits of every choice.
</ul>
</li>

<li> +1 for an example. <i>Ex: A producer of applesauce chooses how many cans of applesauce will be optimal to make</i>
</FRQCheck>

<FRQCheck points={2}>

<FRQ num={4} totalPoints={1}>
<FRQCheck points={1}>
<li> +1 for some difference. Possible answers include:
<ul>
<li> In the short run, one factor of production is fixed but not in the long run. (Anything about plant size goes here)
<li> In the long run, there are no fixed costs and only variable costs (Because no factors of production are fixed)
</ul>
</li>
</FRQCheck>

<FRQ num={5} totalPoints={3}>
<FRQCheck points={1}>
<li> +1 3 utils because MR = MC </li>
</FRQCheck>
<FRQCheck points={2}>
<li> +1 for 3 cones </li>
<li> +1 for a calculation showing that $15 \text{ utils} - 4\cdot3 \text{ utils} = 3 \text{ utils}$ (which is the MC) </li>
</FRQCheck>
</FRQ>

<FRQ num={6} totalPoints={3}>
<FRQCheck points={2}>
<li> +1 for saying 2 </li>
<li> +1 for saying the desired point is the point corresponding to x=4 on the PPC </li>
</FRQCheck>
<FRQCheck points={2}>
<li> +1 for saying stoves
<li> +1 for explaining that it's because the marginal cost is 0.5 cars per stove, so Japan has a comparative advantage in stoves and Taiwan has a comparative advantage in cars
