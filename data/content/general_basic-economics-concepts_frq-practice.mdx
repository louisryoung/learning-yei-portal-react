# FRQ 1

<br />

Joe does not make money from eating chocolate chocolate chip ice cream. He could have mowed the neighbor's lawn for &#36;50 or babysat a cat for &#36;10. What is the opportunity cost of Joe eating ice cream at this point in time?

<FRQ num={1} totalPoints={1}>
  <FRQCheck points={1}>
    <li>
      +1 for $50, because we take the maximum utility among all alternatives to find
      the opportunity cost
    </li>
  </FRQCheck>

# FRQ 2

<ol className="alpha-list-mdx">
  <li> List three basic assumptions of economics. </li>

<FRQ num={2} totalPoints={3}>
  <FRQCheck points={1}>
    <li>
      +1 for each assumption. Possible answers include:
      <ul>
        <li> Society's wants are unlimited, but resources are limited. </li>
        <li>
          
          Due to scarcity, choices must be made. Every choice has a cost.

        <li> Everyone acts in their own self-interest. </li>

# FRQ 3

<br />

Decide if each of the following is microeconomics or macroeconomics and explain.

<ol className="alpha-list-mdx">
  <li>
    
    The costs for one specific firm, JacobCo which is a national monopoly.
  </li>
  <li> GDP of the United States </li>
  <li> The effects of unionization of the labor market in Pusheentown </li>
  <li> The effects of a recession on the micronation of Monaco </li>

# FRQ 4

Describe a difference between short and long run.

<FRQ num={4} totalPoints={1}>
  <FRQCheck points={1}>
    <li>
      
      +1 for some difference. Possible answers include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          
          In the short run, one factor of production is fixed but not in the long
          run. (Anything about plant size goes here)
        </li>
        <li>
          
          In the long run, there are no fixed costs and only variable costs (Because
          no factors of production are fixed)

      </ul>

# FRQ 5

<br />

Joe makes optimal decisions with regards to eating chocolate chocolate chip ice cream.

<ol className="alpha-list-mdx">
  <li>
    
    Assume the marginal cost is fixed at 3 utils per cone. What will be the marginal
    benefit of the last ice cream cone he eats?
  </li>
  <li>
    
    If the marginal benefit starts at 15 utils on the first cone and decreases by
    4 utils for each following cone, what will be the number of cones that Joe eats?
  </li>
</ol>
<FRQ num={5} totalPoints={3}>
  <FRQCheck points={1}>
    <li> +1 3 utils because MR = MC </li>
  </FRQCheck>
  <FRQCheck points={2}>
    <li> +1 for 3 cones </li>
    <li>
      
      +1 for a calculation showing that $15 \text{ utils} - 4 \cdot 3 \text{ utils} =
      3 \text{ utils}$ (which is the MC)
    </li>
  </FRQCheck>
</FRQ>

# FRQ 6

<br />

<ol className="alpha-list-mdx">
  <li>
    
    How would you find the total benefit at a certain quantity $Q$ if you were given
    the marginal benefits of all of the quantities up to $Q$?
  </li>
  <li>
    
    If marginal benefit starts less than marginal cost for eating cookies, how many
    cookies should be eaten?
  </li>
</ol>

<FRQ num={6} totalPoints={2}>
  <FRQCheck points={1}>
    <li> Add up the marginal benefit for all units up to (and including) quantity $Q$ to find the total benefit at quantity $Q$. This would correspond to the area under a marginal benefit curve.
    </li>
  </FRQCheck>
  <FRQCheck points={1}>
    <li> Zero, as marginal benefit will already be less than marginal cost and there is no reason to eat even one cookie.</li>
