# FRQ 3
Assume the a country’s market for grapes is currently at equilibrium. 
<ol className="alpha-list-mdx">
  <li> Assume that the demand for grapes suddenly shifts right. What will happen to the price? </li>
  <li> If the technology for producing grapes has progressed, and supply has increased. Ceteris paribus, what will happen to the price? </li>
  <li> Due to a flurry of articles on the nutritional benefits of mangoes, the demand for grapes has decreased. What effect on price will this have? </li>
</ol>

# FRQ 4
Assume that a country’s market for donuts is currently at equilibrium.
<ol className="alpha-list-mdx">
  <li> How would the supply change if demand for donuts suddenly increased? </li>
  <li> How would an increase in manpower lead to a shift in the supply? Explain. </li>
  <li> Describe how the market would return to equilibrium after supply takes a hit and shifts to the left. </li>
</ol>

<FRQ num={3} totalPoints={3}>
  <FRQCheck points={1}>
    +1 - No change
  </FRQCheck>
  <FRQCheck points={1}>
    +1 - Increase, because an increase in factors of production increases supply. 
  </FRQCheck>
  <FRQCheck points={1}>
    +1 - Increasing price and decreasing quantity
  </FRQCheck>
