Canada is an open economy that is currently in a recessionary output gap.

        On your graph in part (a), show how the economy adjusts to full

    Suppose the Canadian government is unwilling to wait for the long-run
    adjustment process. The marginal propensity to consume is 0.8. The
    equilibrium real output is \$500 billion and the full-employment output is
    \$540 billion.

        Calculate the minimum change and indicate the direction of change in
        government spending required to shift the aggregate demand curve by the

      <li>
        Calculate the minimum change and indicate the direction of change in
        taxes required to shift the aggregate demand curve by the amount of the

  <li>
    Assume instead that the Canadian central bank takes actions to restore the
    economy to full-employment output by influencing investment spending. Draw a
    correctly labeled graph of the money market, and show the effect of the
    actions taken by the central bank on the equilibrium interest rate.

    Canada and Mexico are trading partners. Draw a correctly labeled graph of
    the foreign exchange market of the Canadian dollar, and show the effect of
    the change in the interest rate in part (d) on the value of the Canadian
    dollar with respect to the Mexican peso.
