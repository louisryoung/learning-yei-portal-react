# FRQ 1

Geolabs in a company that makes a unique product that has high barriers to entry and no close substitutes. They are a profit maximizing firm holding a patent for their product.
<ol className='alpha-list-mdx'>
<li>Assume that Geolabs is currently making a profit. Draw a correctly labelled graph showing the quantity they would produce at. </li>
<li>Assume that the government has recently implemented a per unit subsidy on the product Geolabs in making. </li>
<ol>
<li>What would happen to the price and quantity of the product? </li>
<li>What will happen to the amount of money Geolabs makes? </li>
</ol>
<li> Geolabs' patent just expired. </li>
<ol>
<li>How will this affect the market price and quantity? Why? </li>
<li>What will happen to Geolabâ€™s profits? </li>
<li>What market structure would presumably take over in these circumstances? </li>
</ol>

		<li> 1 point for stating they will decrease </li> 
		<li> 1 point for stating that the market structure will most likely be either an oligopoly or monopolistic competition. Award 0.5 points for perfect competition, as the products are likely still to be heterogeneous but this could possibly happen. </li>

John and Co. is the only company in the refrigerator market.
Examine the cost curves.

<ol className='alpha-list-mdx'>
	<li> Find the equilibrium price per unit and quantity, given the cost curves. </li>
	<li> Is John and Co. making an economic profit or an economic loss? Explain how you know. </li>
	<li> Assume that the MC curve is straight between points (24, 4) and (28, 8). Find the deadweight loss from the existence of a monopoly and show how you got it. </li>
	<li> What would happen to the long run profit of John and Co. if the refrigerator market became perfectly competitive? </li>
</ol>

<FRQ num={2} totalPoints={8}>
	<FRQCheck points={2}>
		<ul>
			<li> +1 Price per unit = $21 because it must be at the point on the demand curve where MR = MC.  </li>

# FRQ 3

The Mr. Electric Electric Company is a private, price discriminating, profit maximizing monopoly inside of Wonderland. It currently has no competition and Wonderland is suffering from the lack of consumer surplus created by the Mr. Electric Electric Company and its price descrimination.

<ol className='alpha-list-mdx'>
	<li>
		Draw a properly labeled graph for Mr. Electric Electric Company and show each of the following:
		<ol>
			<li> The profit maximizing quantity of electricity labeled $Q_m$ </li>
			<li> The demand and marginal revenue curves </li>
			<li> A shaded region representing the total profits of the monopoly </li>
		</ol> 
	</li>
	<li> Is there any deadweight loss at the profit maximizing quantity? </li>
	<li> Is the market at allocative efficiency? </li>
	<li> What is one government action that can be taken to regulate this monopoly and increase consumer surplus? </li>
