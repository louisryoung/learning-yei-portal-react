# FRQ 1
Say the government wishes to improve general welfare. What are 3 ways public goods it could use to accomplish this goal?

<FRQ num={1} totalPoints={3}>
	<FRQCheck points={3}>
		The government could provide services such as firefighting, hospitals, education, and policing as public goods.
		+1 for each example

# FRQ 2
<ol className='alpha-list-mdx'>
	<li>How does the marginal social benefit differ from the marginal benefit for an individual? Give an example.</li>
	<li> At what point would consumption of a public resource be deemed efficient?</li>
</ol>

<FRQ num={2} totalPoints={3}>
	The marginal social benefit differs in the sense that it encapsulates the total benefit for all of society rather than a single person. For example the benefits of a vaccine would be greater to society than to just one person.

		<ul>
			<li>State that social benefit encapsulates the total benefit for a wider society.</li>
			<li>Give an example.</li>
		</ul>
	</FRQCheck>
	<FRQCheck points={1}>
		State that the efficient point is the point where marginal social benefit intersects marginal social cost.

Do the following have negative or positive externalities?

<li> Smoking </li>
<li> Vaccines </li>
<li> Pollution </li>
</ol>

<FRQ num={5} totalPoints={3}>
<FRQCheck points={1}> Negative externality, because secondhand smoke affects other people. </FRQCheck>
<FRQCheck points={1}> Positive externality, because vaccination lowers contagion rates which benefits everyone. </FRQCheck>
<FRQCheck points={1}> Negative externality, because pollution contributes to climate change, which has negative global impact. </FRQCheck>

2018 AP Micro Set 1 Problem 2

Modern-day word processing software gives consumers the ability to create and save documents in different file formats that can then be accessed by multiple computer operating systems. The graph below depicts a perfectly competitive market for word processing software. In the graph, MSB is the marginal social benefit, MPB is the marginal private benefit, MPC is the marginal private cost, and MSC is the marginal social cost.

<li> Identify the type of market failure illustrated by the graph. Explain. </li>
<li> Using the numbers on the graph, identify the market equilibrium price and quantity. </li>
