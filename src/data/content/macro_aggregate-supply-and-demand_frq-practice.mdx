    Assume that in the nation of Fishyland there is rampant inflation but there is no change in demand.

        What is the type of inflation that fits the description?

      +1  for saying that LRAS is vertical
    </li>
    <li>
      +1  for pointing out that LRAS is vertical because it is the aggregate supply in the long run when all resources are employed (full potential output), and thus does not vary based on real GDP (current output).

    </li>
    <li>
      +2  for saying that high inflation already reduces the purchasing power of consumers but high unemployment further reduces this power. Therefore, there is less money that is worth less.
